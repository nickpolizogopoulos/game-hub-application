# React - GameHub AppLication

This is my first React project using TypeScript and Chakra UI during my React v18 course.

A Gaming Hub where you can browse games that can be filtered by Platform, Genres and many more options while every title has it's own page with description, attributes, teaser trailer and pictures.
